Hi, i'm Max. 

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst, with specialisation in Biological Bioinformatics using next-generation sequencing (NGS) transcriptomic and proteomic data.

I am currently working as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at Queen Mary's University's (QMUL) Barts Cancer Institute (BCI) with Alastair Lamb on the SPACE study. My research focuses on improving our understanding of why only certain prostate cancer clones within a patient (intratumoural) undergo metastasis. I will apply next-generation spatial transcriptomics to investigate clonal evolution, identify key driver mutations and better understand clonal interaction with the stromal tumour microenvironment (TME).My research focuses on improving our understanding of why only certain prostate cancer clones within a patient (intratumoural) undergo metastasis.

Previously, I worked as a post-doctoral research associate at the University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street ICH Zayed Centre, where I combined advanced computational skills with cutting-edge RNA sequencing techniques to conduct world-leading human medical research. During my PhD and earlier clinical experience, I taught undergraduates, project managed MSc students, presented at international conferences, was a co-applicant on large grant applications and led scientific publications. As well as my technical scientific expertise, these experiences allowed me to develop a range of data analysis, communication and management skills. It also gave me the opportunity to lead complex projects and combine practical, computational and data visualisation skills to produce informative high-level scientific publications. 

My interests are in the use of data analytics and computation to advance human medical research for the improvement of healthcare for all.

Most recent work includes scRNAseq analysis of the amniotic fluid which led to a publication in Nature Medicine (www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02807-z/). Figure 1, shown below, particuarly demonstrates my analyses and visualisations.  V1 of the dataset is available through the Human Cell Atlas at explore.data.humancellatlas.org/projects/19037ec9-43a7-4823-b93f-9e59c694d17e
