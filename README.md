Hi, i'm Max. I recently completed my work as a post-doctoral research associate at the University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street ICH Zayed Centre, where I combined advanced computational skills with cutting-edge RNA sequencing techniques to conduct world-leading human medical research. During my PhD and earlier clinical experience, I taught undergraduates, project managed MSc students, presented at international conferences, was a co-applicant on large grant applications and led scientific publications. As well as my technical scientific expertise, these experiences allowed me to develop a range of data analysis, communication and management skills. It also gave me the opportunity to lead complex projects and combine practical, computational and data visualisation skills to produce informative high-level scientific publications. 

My interests are in the use of data analytics and computation to advance human medical research for the improvement of healthcare for all.
